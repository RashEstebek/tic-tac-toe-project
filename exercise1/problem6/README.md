# Problem 6

Write a function that inserts a white space between every instance of a lower character followed immediately by an upper
character.

```js
console.log(insertWhitespace("SheWalksToTheBeach")) // "She Walks To The Beach"

console.log(insertWhitespace("MarvinTalksTooMuch")) // "Marvin Talks Too Much"

console.log(insertWhitespace("TheGreatestUpsetInHistory")) // "The Greatest Upset In History"
```
