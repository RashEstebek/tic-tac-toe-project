# Problem 3

Print numbers from `1` to `n` with delay of the numberâ€™s second between each value being printed

```ts
printAsyncNumbers(3)
// after 1 sec - 1
// after 2 sec - 2
// after 3 sec - 3

printAsyncNumbers(10)
// after 1 sec - 1
// after 2 sec - 2
// after 3 sec - 3
// ...
// after 10 sec - 10
```
